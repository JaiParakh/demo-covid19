# Name of the App

COVID-19 pandemic has become a cause of worldwide destruction. One of the main challenges is tracking and breaking the spread. People over the world have been practicing social distancing, despite this, a recent WHO report reveals there are as many as 50-60 times more cases than the documented cases.
We need technology that tracks people with vulnerability and ensures social distancing for everyone.
We believe smartphones are one such technology which may help people and government in these dark times.
