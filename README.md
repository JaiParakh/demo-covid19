## Problem Statement

COVID-19 pandemic has become a cause of worldwide destruction. <b>One of the main challenges is tracking and breaking the spread.</b> People over the world have been practicing social distancing, despite this, a recent WHO report reveals there are as many as 50-60 times more cases than the documented cases.
We need technology that tracks people with vulnerability and ensures social distancing for everyone.
We believe smartphones are one such technology which may help people and government in these dark times.

## Proposed Solution

What if you get a trigger from your phone if you violate social distancing or you met a vulnerable person? Its human nature to forget these norms while communicating, and that’s what awareness is all about. Also what if one need not remember all the people he/she met during any pandemic. 

We bring up an idea through an application platform where user can ensure social distancing and along with it, if a person gets a virus then all other people directly or indirectly are vulnerable gets notified about the vulnerability. With the help of Artificial Intelligence approaches we will be conducting multiple questionnaires based on data available for various stages of symptoms and spread of the virus in body. This will inform the users of the application regarding risks of him being exposed or sick due to cornavirus.

In this way, we will be able to break the spread chain, enforce social distancing and respective authorities will get the data to track vulnerable people as well.

## How The App Works

### For User
- Once the users install the application they will be authenticated via OTP.
- Phone numbers will be used to uniquely identify users.
- The users will be required to enter their current medical state.
- Upon entering the above-mentioned info they can start using the app.
- The app will notify the user if he/she has been in close contact with a suspected case(s). This info will be notified to the local bodies as well.

### For Government
- Government can closely monitor the situation.
- It will help them track and notify the affected people.

### How will this app help in breaking the chain?
It is not always possible that the infected person remembers every person they met during the spread of the virus in the body.  And what if in just one click all the people that he/she met and people’s people <b>(the chain)</b> will get notified that they may be vulnerable because somehow they are in the chain of virus spread.(obviously by isolating themselves from family and avoiding meeting other contacts). <b>This way the chain will be broken and the spread would halt. </b>

### How will it helpin maintaining social distancing?
